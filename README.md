# vwio_eskf
ROS1 Package Using ESKF Method for Muti-Sensor Fusion(Wheel Odometry, IMU, Visual Odometry)

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) algorithm for multi-sensor fusion. The fusion involves Wheel Odometry (WO), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and Visual Odometry (VO) sensors.

## Ongoing Updates
I am currently updating this repository to improve the performance and functionality of the ESKF algorithm. The main focus of the updates is on solving the accuracy issues in the Wheel-Inertial Odometry (WIO) component to enhance its precision and reliability.
